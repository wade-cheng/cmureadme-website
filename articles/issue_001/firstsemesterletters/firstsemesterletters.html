I still kinda can&rsquo;t believe I got into such a good school, what are the odds lol. Anyways this week looks super packed, they have stuff planned for us every day. Some of this stuff looks really intense, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be super fun! Don&rsquo;t worry though, I&rsquo;ll make sure to call you every night before I go to bed &#6507;&#7009; I&rsquo;m so excited to meet my floormates, a lot of the activities seem to be bonding stuff so we&rsquo;ll probably be super close by the end of orientation! College is gonna be awesome :)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">8/28/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hi mom,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So that was a lot lol. They had us running around trying to juggle activities a lot but I made it through! A lot of the stuff was cool and I definitely enjoyed getting to meet everybody, but towards the back half I got kinda burnt out. I think it was good though, I got to pick and choose my interactions more intentionally instead of being forced on a bunch of ppl to inorganically &ldquo;meet&rdquo; them. I made a bunch of friends in those moments that I didn&rsquo;t engage with the o-week schedule and those were some of the moments I enjoyed the most~ O-week was really overstimulating at times, it felt like they had us just going from one thing to the next. The whole thing kinda felt like a summer camp, so I&rsquo;m ready for regular school to kick in lol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9/4/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hey ma,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">First week of classes done!! I really like most of my classes so far, and I feel like I&rsquo;m set to handle things on my own pretty well. I know it&rsquo;s just the beginning and things will get busier, but I feel good going into the semester. There are a couple of classes I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of, but it&rsquo;s whatever. I&rsquo;ll get through it just like everything else, not everything is gonna be my cup of tea of course. Some of my classes are really cool! I&rsquo;m excited to tell you about what we&rsquo;ve been working on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">9/27/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Things have been getting busy but I&rsquo;m having a great time. Still enjoying my classes, as busy as they keep me lol. Definitely ready for fall break though. It&rsquo;ll be nice to be home again and see everybody without having to worry about school. The food on campus isn&rsquo;t great either, I can&rsquo;t wait to have a home-cooked meal again. I miss everybody back home, but my friends here have been great too. Hopefully I can get everything I need to done before break, I fell a little bit behind on some work but I&rsquo;m still generally on top of it. Would love to have it out of the way so when I get home I can just relax and be home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">10/24/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That break wasn&rsquo;t long enough. I wasn&rsquo;t able to catch up on all my homework so now I&rsquo;ve gotta play a bit of catch-up while juggling the new work coming in too. Classes are still fun I guess, there&rsquo;s just so much shit to do. Sorry I haven&rsquo;t been calling as much, I&rsquo;ve been super busy. I feel like they&rsquo;re just drowning us in work for no reason. I&rsquo;m not doing any of the readings anymore and I still feel like there&rsquo;s too much work for me to do. At least I&rsquo;ve been able to stay on top of my laundry and shit. I haven&rsquo;t had time to see my friends as often as I&rsquo;d like anymore, but I still go out when I get the chance. I&rsquo;m sure once I catch up I&rsquo;ll be able to socialize more again. Until then I just need to focus on my work and make sure I don&rsquo;t fall any further behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">11/30/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">i&rsquo;m losing my mind a little bit here if i&rsquo;m being honest ma. i don&rsquo;t have any free time anymore. i&rsquo;m going from my room to my classes and back. i barely have time to eat, i can&rsquo;t study in the library cuz there are too many people and it&rsquo;s distracting. my clean laundry has been sitting there in the bin waiting to be put away for two weeks because i just don&rsquo;t have the energy. i&rsquo;m surprised i even managed to get it clean, to be honest. i&rsquo;ve become a complete hermit, i haven&rsquo;t seen my friends in a month and i&rsquo;m sure they all hate me by now because i don&rsquo;t talk to them. either that or they&rsquo;ve forgotten i exist. i&rsquo;ve been pretty much coasting through my classes hoping i can keep my average high enough to not flunk out at this point. i don&rsquo;t even know if i&rsquo;m enjoying it anymore because i have no time to think, it&rsquo;s all just more shit i need to do. I haven&rsquo;t gone to bed earlier than 4am for the past two weeks so between that and my 8ams i&rsquo;ve been averaging like two and a half hours of sleep every night. finals are coming up in a bit so i guess this is the home stretch. not looking forward to going through finals but if i can just make it there, the semester will be over and i&rsquo;ll be able to breathe. i just need to make it there&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">12/20/23:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">i&rsquo;m so fucked.</span></p></body></html>
