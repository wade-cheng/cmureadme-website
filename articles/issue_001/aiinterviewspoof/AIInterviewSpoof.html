Millions of prompts are sent every day to OpenAI&rsquo;s groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT. Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s students in particular have quickly latched on to this new way to avoid their homework. However, behind ChatGPT&rsquo;s shiny facade lies a foundation of exploitation and a culture of overwork. To lay bare the problems within OpenAI, Journalist Benner Rogers conducted a bombshell interview with an anonymous employee on what it&rsquo;s like working for the face of AI. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Before the questions begin, could you please explain why you would like to remain anonymous?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I mean, job security mostly? I&rsquo;d like to keep my paycheck, haha. And I don&rsquo;t think the other people working on ChatGPT would like what I&rsquo;m about to say. I have a family that I need to support and my wife said she&rsquo;d kick me out if I quit my job. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Can you run through an average day at OpenAI?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Usually I work ten, maybe twelve-hour days. And really like ninety percent of that is just sitting behind a computer. We&rsquo;re a small team, right? And the popularity of ChatGPT is making it really hard to maintain this front we&rsquo;ve been putting up, this facade of the AI&rsquo;s technical abilities. Users think that they&rsquo;re talking to this super advanced, almost top-of-the-line technology and in reality it&rsquo;s just some guy you&rsquo;re basically emailing back and forth with. I mean if people found out all their questions were being answered by some computer science geek who almost failed out of college they&rsquo;d freak out. C&rsquo;s may get degrees, but they definitely don&rsquo;t inspire confidence in your ability to act as an all-knowing robot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Hold on, are you saying that ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t actually real?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It&rsquo;s all bullshit. All of it. Sure, we </span><span class="c5">tried </span><span>to make a crazy-smart AI, but in reality </span><span class="c0">ChatGPT can barely tell you that 2+2=4. It was a complete fucking failure. None of it is real. Absolutely nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Then how are users seeing such impressive answers if the AI is so inadequate?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I bust my ass manually answering every single prompt someone sends in. I&rsquo;ve gotten carpal tunnel but I don&rsquo;t have any time to treat it. Do you know how fast you have to type to get through everyone&rsquo;s questions? It&rsquo;s insane, man. Absolutely insane. And I can&rsquo;t take credit for any of it. I&rsquo;ve written more than basically anyone else in the past year, answered an absurd amount of questions, and when my kids ask me what I do for work I have to lie about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">That must be hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And let me tell you, there are some </span><span class="c5">freaks</span><span>&nbsp;using our site. Like, I can&rsquo;t even repeat some of the stuff they ask me. Absolutely fucking atrocious. Even worse, the questions are so </span><span class="c5">stupid </span><span class="c0">too. You&rsquo;re telling me you can&rsquo;t write a single email? Grow up. If another goddamn person asks me a simple math question or to write some short story they can&rsquo;t be bothered to write themselves I&rsquo;m going to lose it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">What kind of question is hardest for you to answer?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jesus, one time some twelve-year-old asked me to explain the housing crash of 2008 like I was a caveman. How on earth am I supposed to do that?! What does a caveman even sound like? Or maybe it was the time I had to write a legal brief for some court case. Look, man, I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. I just made some stuff up and dressed it up all nice. I&rsquo;m praying that nonsense didn&rsquo;t send someone to jail. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on college finals week. Hope your extra hour partying was worth me working overtime for a month straight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Oh that reminds me, could you help me with a paper for my-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Go fuck yourself.</span></p></body></html>
